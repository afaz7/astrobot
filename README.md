Please read CONTRIBUTING.md <need to create one> for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us. That fact that the code is for both DISCORD and SLACK is a result of contributors outside of NASA who adapted the code to work with DISCORD. We welcome contributions!
